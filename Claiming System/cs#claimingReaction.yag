    Reaction Responses Function
    DESCRIPTION: Handles the reactions of this command.
    PARAMS: 
    .Guild {Guild Object} I added this object so we could retrieve the icon of the guild. Will we ever have a method for that? SMH.
    .ReactionName <String> We need this for the function to work. It's the name of the reaction sent by the user.
    .Vows [Array] Vows is a simple string array that contains data from another command. The function can be ran without this.
    .User {User Object} The user who triggered the command.
    .Target {User Object} The target to be used for the ":two:" condition.
    .TargetOwner <String> The string to be used if the target is claimed by someone.
    .ForbiddenClaimChannel <number> The channel ID of the forbidden claim channel used in condition ":two:"
    .ForbiddenAccessRole <number> The ID of the role that has access to the channel above.
    .Channel <number> The current channel ID for the comment listener.
