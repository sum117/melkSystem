DESCRIPTION: This is a command that takes many arguments and is used to decide wether or not two elements want to "partner" up, as requested by the buyer. Included in this file are the following operations: 1. The first user locks himself and the target into a database value and leaves the second subject to choose if they'll be connected to each other; 2. The second user uses the options <accept|reject> to choose if they'll be connected or not to the request sender; 3. Finally, if no args are exemplified, the output will be the current partner of the supplied user trigger.
RECOMMENDED TRIGGER: Command Trigger; partner
USAGE METHOD: -partner <accept|deny|request|mention> <if request is used: mention>
